The steps involved in the project are:

1. Exploring the dataset also visualizing as well as cleaning the data set .

2. Data preprocessing

3. Building machine learning models using logistic regression

4. Evaluating the models

5. Final model creation and analysis outcome by preparing classification report and confusion matrix and accuracy score.


Final result of analysis:
The accuracy obtained is 99.98%
